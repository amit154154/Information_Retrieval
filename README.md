By lack of time I didn't manage to implement the gcp to work with the project,
and I couldnt manage to implement the search engine to work.
I can show what I planed and wanted to do, but I couldn't manage to do it.
you can see the start in process.py.

My planing was to use NLP models to encode the documents body and title and then
use the cosine similarity to find the most similar documents to the query.

I also wanted to use the gcp to upload the documents to the cloud and then use
the cloud to run the search engine, but I couldnt mange to do so.

I wanted to create Index to the body that will store the body 
encodeing using the paper ["Efficient Long-Text Understanding with Short-Text Models"(2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.00748)
and use simple bert model to encode the title and then use the cosine similarity between the query and the documents.

I had a lot of problems with the gcp and I couldn't manage to do it, and in the end I tried to the minumom to pass but coldnt mange to do so.

I hope you will understand and I let me pass the course without the project.
